## Career Objective

I am a web developer with a passion for producing beautiful and functional user
experiences where accessibility and responsiveness are not an afterthought but a
primary consideration. I am interested in the intersection of Design, User
Experience and Development and how to best use these foundations to create
responsive and and engaging digital journeys. I am eager to find a new role that
is challenging and rewarding, allowing me to work to my strengths as well as
grow my professional skills.
